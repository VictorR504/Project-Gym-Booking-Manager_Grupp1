|                     |          | a notification to all affected users (customers and         |
|                     |          | trainers). Some reservable resources can also be impacted.  |

|                     |          | staff (coach, PT). Although customers should not have       |
|                     |          | full access to item time table, they may need               |
|                     |          | availability information indirectly.                        |

| Make Reservation    | Staff    | Reserve some thing for a timeslot. Some items have          |
|                     | Customer | associated fees, for which any customer can book.           |
|                     |          | Some items do not, and thus instead require                 |
|                     |          | a membership or day pass instead (with some additional      |
|                     |          | limitations imposed). Staff may also reserve items for      |
|                     |          | group activities. TODO: How general is a reservation; the   |

| Cancel/Change       | Staff    | A customer can cancel any of their reservations.            |
| Reservation         | Customer | Staff can also cancel on behalf of customers.               |
|                     |          | This may include some special processing, e.g. partial      |
|                     |          | fee reimbursement. This can affect a group activity,        |
|                     |          | thus requiring special handling.                            |
|                     |          | In either case, a notification of the cancellation          |
|                     |          | should be pushed.                                           |

|                     |          | It may be prudent to consider this status as distinct       |
|                     |          | from "member", although functionally they will enjoy        |
|                     |          | the same privileges, albeit under time restriction.         |
|                     |          | For simplicity's sake, day pass can currently only be       |

|                     |          | renovations; a gym machine can be marked for "repair"       |
|                     |          | after inspection.                                           |
